  # This plugin deals with the "short bari ye" problem where a short sequence
  # ending in a bari ye is not long enough to clear the negative RSB of the
  # bari ye tail, and so the tail pokes into the preceding word. (Happens with
  # sequences like ابے) This rule works out the width of all possible sequences
  # and adds a kern to the initial glyph to separate it from the end of the
  # preceding word.
